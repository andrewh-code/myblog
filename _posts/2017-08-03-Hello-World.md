I decided to take up blogging again since I have more free time these days. I won't link my old blog account because, well there's a lot of things that I am too embarrassed to share from that blog :D 


When creating a new blog, there were a couple of major publishing platforms that I wanted to look at. Specifically, they are:
+ Wordpress
+ Blogger
+ Medium
+ Github Pages (With Jekyll)

I think everyone knows the pros and cons and what each blogging platform provides for its users. Specifically for this new blog that I am attempting to write, I wanted to 
talk more specifically about my programming endeavors (whether or not they are with new/current technologies, projects, coding challenges, or my thoughts on something).
The biggest thing that I wanted for my new blog is for the platform to have features that are programmer friendly (examples being markdown integration, formatting code, allowing to have pictures and diagrams, and showing stats and view counts for the blog).

I decided to do some research on each blogging platform and create a comparison matrix to find out which one is best for me:

Criteria    | Wordpress | Blogger   | Medium    | Github Pages 
----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------
Easy to Use | x         | x         | x         | 
Easy UI/UX  | x         |           | x         | 
Programmer Friendly | x | x         | x         | 
Pictures    | x         | x         | x         | 
Blog Stats | x          | x         |           | 


During my research into what platforms I should use, I realized that even though the most established platforms out there provide pretty much everything that I needed, the biggest requirement that I had was actually, have I used it before?
Here's an updated chart with that special requirement:

Criteria    | Wordpress | Blogger   | Medium    | Github Pages 
----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------
Have I used it before| x| x         |           | 
Easy to Use | x         | x         | x         | 
Easy UI/UX  | x         |           | x         | 
Programmer Friendly | x | x         | x         | 
Pictures    | x         | x         | x         | 
Blog Stats | x          | x         |           | 


As you can see, the only blogging platforms that I haven't even touched are Medium (Is it considered a blogging platform?) and Github Pages. Even though Github pages does not meet ANY of the other criteria, I decided that I wanted to create my new blog through Github Pages and the Jekyll platform. **This is only because I have never touched this sort of thing before**.

So that's pretty much it, I decided to create my new blog with Github Pages and Jekyll because I have never done it before and it seems cool to have a blog on Github.


At the time of configuring the type-theme Jekyll blog to fit my desires and writing my first blog post, I realized that setting everything up is A LOT HARDER than I thought. 
I decided to create a Medium account for my blog because it's so much easier to do that than configure Jekyll... 
Also, I don't know how to use markdown...that's a big one too...

I'll probably write things to my Medium account first and then update this blog after

Here's my Medium account while we're at it: [https://medium.com/@andrewh.code](https://medium.com/@andrewh.code)
